## Sprint Retrospective

- To be done on the 26/01/2024

### Action Items from last sprint

- I will try to complete all the tasks in the next sprint by spending more time on the project.
- I aim to speed up the progress in the next sprint by resolving the blockers.

### What went well:

- Resilience in finding a solution to resolve blockers
- Speeding up progress once blockers were resolved

### What didn't go well:

- Unanticipated blockers, which led to little progress although a good start was made on the map display - 14

### Action Items

- Refine the issues and prioritize for the sprint focussing on achieving an MVP to demonstrate the core functionality of the application.
- Speed up progress by spending more time on the project.
