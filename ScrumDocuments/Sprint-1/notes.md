## Sprint Review

Some progress was made on the authentication. The authentication had been initially implemented using supabase however, the authentication was changed to use parse server.This was due to high workload on other course work for other modules.

- Screens for sign up and sign in were implemented and some functionality was added but not exhaustively.
- The reset password functionality was not implemented.
- The remove user account functionality was not implemented.
