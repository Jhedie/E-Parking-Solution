   With user expectations shaped by popular apps, building successful mobile experiences for internal or consumer use has become challenging. Reactive experiences and real-time data are now expected. This requires developers to build complicated logic and reinvent the wheel â€“ to sync data between users, platforms, and the cloud, handle unreliable internet connectivity and exceptions, and more. We'll explore the various options on MongoDB that were designed to make this simple.

9. An issue with react native maps:

- I encountered an error message when performing an eas build to enable google maps on IOS. The problem was fixed by reading through the github issue below:
  It indicated that there is an issue with building the module 'GoogleMapsUtils'. The provided code fixed this issue by modifying the Podfile in the iOS project. I had to create a plugin file called `react-native-maps-plugin.js`` in the root directory of the project and add this file to the app.json file.
