## Updates:

- Working on the secure parking spot feature. #15

- Met with Karim to align in terms of requirements and your expectations.
  the project requirements:
  Questions asked:
- What is the expected output of the project?
- What are the main features that you are looking for in the project?
- What things are you looking for in my project that would help you decide on a good grade?

notes from meeting:
Driver's Perspective: The system allows drivers to book parking spaces, with features to cancel or change bookings. The assessment will focus on how well the system manages exceptions.

Parking Owner's Perspective: Owners can list new parking spaces by providing details such as location, maps, and slot availability. This information is sent to the admin for verification and approval.

Admin's Role: Admins receive notifications of new parking space listings, verify the information, and approve the listings. They also oversee data regarding parking usage and financial performance.

Additional User - Parking Attendant: An optional user role being considered is the parking attendant, who monitors parking space usage and ensures compliance with booking times. This role requires access control to view assigned parking information.

System Design and User Experience: The system's design is crucial due to its lack of complex algorithms. It should be intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing to compensate for the simplicity of its technical architecture.

Potential for Algorithmic Enhancement: Introducing algorithmic features is advised only after ensuring the core system and its primary features are well-implemented. This approach can enhance technical achievement and user experience but should not detract from the system's fundamental functionality.

Project Assessment and Marks: The project's assessment will consider technical achievements, user experience design, and the implementation of additional features. A well-executed project with innovative features can achieve a higher grade, but basics such as functionality, appearance, and user experience are critical.

Development Process and Documentation: The conversation touched on the importance of following the Scrum methodology, documenting progress in a GitLab repository, and ensuring milestones correspond with actual progress.

Literature Review and Dissertation: The project requires a background research component to understand and reference existing parking apps and technologies, emphasizing the need to offer unique value without directly copying existing solutions.

Use of External Libraries and Frameworks: Utilizing external resources is acceptable to a degree, provided they do not automate the core functionality of the project entirely. Proper referencing and customization of these resources are necessary.

## Issues:

No issues at the moment.

## Action Item:

Continue working on the secure parking spot feature. #15
