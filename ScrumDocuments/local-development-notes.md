   With user expectations shaped by popular apps, building successful mobile experiences for internal or consumer use has become challenging. Reactive experiences and real-time data are now expected. This requires developers to build complicated logic and reinvent the wheel â€“ to sync data between users, platforms, and the cloud, handle unreliable internet connectivity and exceptions, and more. We'll explore the various options on MongoDB that were designed to make this simple.

   - Once the user verifies, they are taken to the welcome page to sign in
   - Once signed in, they are taken to the home page
   - when the user signs out, they are taken to the welcome page
   - when the app is closed and reopened, the user is taken to the home page if they are signed in, otherwise they are taken to the welcome page
   - when the app is closed and the is user but not verified, they are taken to the verification page
   - when the app is closed after verification and reopened, the user is taken to the welcome page

9. An issue with react native maps:

- I encountered an error message when performing an eas build to enable google maps on IOS. The problem was fixed by reading through the github issue below:
  It indicated that there is an issue with building the module 'GoogleMapsUtils'. The provided code fixed this issue by modifying the Podfile in the iOS project. I had to create a plugin file called `react-native-maps-plugin.js`` in the root directory of the project and add this file to the app.json file.

Handling multiple dates logic:

```
// State variables to track if the start and end dates have been picked
  const [isStartDatePicked, setIsStartDatePicked] = useState(false);
  const [isEndDatePicked, setIsEndDatePicked] = useState(false);

  // Function to handle when a day is pressed
  const onDayPress = (day: DateData) => {
    console.log("selected day", day.dateString);

    // If the start date hasn't been picked or both dates have been picked, set the start date
    if (!isStartDatePicked || (isStartDatePicked && isEndDatePicked)) {
      setStartDate(day.dateString);
      setEndDate("");
      setIsStartDatePicked(true);
      setIsEndDatePicked(false);
    }
    // If the start date has been picked but the end date hasn't, set the end date
    else if (!isEndDatePicked) {
      // If the selected day is before the start date, swap the start and end dates
      if (dayjs(day.dateString).isBefore(startDate)) {
        setEndDate(startDate);
        setStartDate(day.dateString);
      }
      // Otherwise, just set the end date
      else {
        setEndDate(day.dateString);
      }
      setIsEndDatePicked(true);
    }
  };

  // State variables to store the start and end dates
  const [startDate, setStartDate] = useState("");
  const [endDate, setEndDate] = useState("");
  // Function to generate the marked dates object
  const getMarkedDates = () => {
    let marked = {};
    if (startDate === endDate) {
      marked = {
        [startDate]: {
          startingDay: true,
          endingDay: true,
          color: "green",
          textColor: "white"
        }
      };
    } else {
      // Initialize the marked dates object with the start and end dates
      marked = {
        [startDate]: { startingDay: true, color: "green", textColor: "white" },
        [endDate]: { endingDay: true, color: "green", textColor: "white" }
      };

      // Start from the day after the start date
      let start = dayjs(startDate).add(1, "day");
      const end = dayjs(endDate);

      // Iterate over the dates between the start and end dates
      while (start.isBefore(end)) {
        // Add each date to the marked dates object
        marked[start.format("YYYY-MM-DD")] = {
          selected: true,
          marked: true,
          selectedColor: "blue"
        };
        // Move to the next date
        start = start.add(1, "day");
      }
    }
    return marked;
  };
