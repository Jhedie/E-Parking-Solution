## Sprint Review

- To be done on the 24/02/2024

### Action Items from last sprint

- The aim of sprint 4 was to focus on or prioritise issues that contribute to achieving an MVP. I looked at the
  - Map Display - #14
  - Add parking lots and information - #6
  - Find parking spots and view their locations - #4
  - Secure a parking spot - #15

### Review

- A lot of API development was done in this sprint. The main focus was on the secure parking spot feature.
- The user interface was enhanced to improve the user experience. The MVP was achieved for the demo with the second marker and the meeting helped to identify the next steps for the project.
- Some backend parts are missing and need to be completed.
